# Rabbai

A prompt engineering project that simulates responses from different Jewish rabbinic traditions using LLMs (Large Language Models).

## ✡️ About the Project

This tool lets users ask halachic-style questions and receive answers styled after:
- Sephardi rabbis
- Hasidic rabbis
- Litvish (Lithuanian) rabbis

It attempts to:
- Quote real poskim when possible
- Offer clear halachic-style guidance
- Remind users this is *not* a real halachic ruling
